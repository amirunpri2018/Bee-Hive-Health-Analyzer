Live Web App:

This is a prototype for a freely available online tool that can predict the health of a bee hive by looking at an image of a bee. This could help bee keepers and bee researchers estimate the health of a bee hive without having to disturb the hive itself. 

The app outputs 6 possible bee hive conditions:

0: "healthy",
1: "few varrao, hive beetles",
2: "varroa, small hive beetles",
3: "ant problems",
4: "hive being robbed",
5: "missing queen"



Model F1 score: 0.96

The process used to build and train the model is described in this Kaggle kernel:
